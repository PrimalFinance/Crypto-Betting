# Overview

A pool is created with two tokens, for example TokenA & TokenB.
Users are able to bet on which token they think will perform better within the pools duration.

For example,

-   At the start of the pool, TokenA = $5, and TokenB = $100.
-   At the end of the pool, TokenA = $10, and TokenB = $120.

-   In this instance users who bet on TokenA would have won this round of the pool.
    -   This is because TokenA's performance of ($5 -> $10) = 100% increase.
    -   While TokenB's performance ($100 -> $120) = 20% increase.
    -   Since TokenA had a larger increase in terms of %, users that bet on this token won.
